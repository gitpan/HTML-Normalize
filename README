NAME
    HTML::Normalize - HTML light weight cleanup

VERSION
    Version 1.0002

SYNOPSIS
        my $norm = HTML::Normalize->new ();
        my $cleanHtml = $norm->cleanup (-html => $dirtyHtml);

DESCRIPTION
    HTML::Normalize uses HTML::TreeBuilder to parse an HTML string then
    processes the resultant tree to clean up various structural issues in
    the original HTML. The result is then rendered using HTML::Element's
    as_HTML member or an internal renderer.

    Key structural clean ups fix tag soup ("<b><i>foo</b></i>" becomes
    "<b><i>foo</i></b>") and inline/block element nesting
    ("<span><p>foo</p></span>" becomes "<p><span>foo</span></p>"). "<br>"
    tags at the start or end of a link element are migrated out of the
    element.

    HTML::Normalize can also remove attributes set to default values and
    empty elements. For example a "<font face="Verdana" size="1"
    color="#FF0000">" element would become and "<font color="#FF0000">" and
    "<font face="Verdana" size="1">" would be removed if Verdana size 1 is
    set as the default font.
